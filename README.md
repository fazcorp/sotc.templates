# sotc.templates
f2u templates for sotc.

- please credit when using, i don't care where the credits are, you're free to move it around.
- keep the credit even if you heavily edit the template.
- you may take inspiration from these templates, i don't mind, but do not pass it off as your own entire idea.
- please be aware *not all of my formatting is F2U.* if it isn't in here, it is not f2u!!!!!
- requests? questions? confused? other fun stuff? contact me @cornflowers. !

# other notes.
- requests are currently open, you can ping/dm me accordingly or fill out [this form]()
- all my formats are non-nitro inclusive, though i can't promise they'll look the way they are intended to.
- requests i take will be posted here, meaning they will be f2u for everybody including you!!
- i can't take requests for specific characters; that's a seperate thing that i'm going to end up offering seperately
- requests probably won't be done immediately or even soon after requests, i tend to wait for motivation or periods of time i have nothing to do LOL


there's no need to download anything, clicking on the respective files will open a tab where you are able to copy and paste.
these are added to periodically, keep checking for more!
