f2u templates for sotc.

- please credit when using, i don't care where the credits are, you're free to move it around *as long as it is noticeable*. **I HAVE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY ABOUT THIS. I HAVE HAD MY CREDITS REMOVED REPEATEDLY AND I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS. action *can* and *will* be taken if you remove my credits on *any of my formats*. if this persists i will forbid *anyone* from using my formatting.**
- keep the credit even if you heavily edit the template. (for a correction on this, this only applies if it is still recognizable as the original formatting, if it's something entirely different visual wise i do not mind)
- you may take inspiration from these templates, i don't mind, but do not pass it off as your own entire idea. *please ask before doing this, alongside asking before taking snippets of my formatting.*
- please be aware *not all of my formatting is F2U.* if it isn't in here, it is not f2u!!!!!
- additionally; i let my close friends use my non-f2u formatting as they please, it's not permits for anyone to use them, please recognize that i spend time on these things and it is discouraging to see unfair useage. if u see someone using my formatting w/o credits please dm me<3
- please **do not frankenstein (mix or merge) my formats** with others', unless you have *explicit permission* to do so (or it is your own)!! even if it's a small snippet of both, i do not want people to go uncredited for their creations.
- requests? questions? confused? other fun stuff? contact me @cornflowers. !

# other notes.
- requests are currently open, you can ping/dm me accordingly or fill out [this form]()
- all my formats are non-nitro inclusive, though i can't promise they'll look the way they are intended to.
- requests i take will be posted here, meaning they will be f2u for everybody including you!!
- i can't take requests for specific characters; that's a seperate thing that i'm going to end up offering seperately
- requests probably won't be done immediately or even soon after requests, i tend to wait for motivation or periods of time i have nothing to do LOL

# guide
- **[E]** - replace these *along with the brackets* with an emoji of your choice!
- **[NUMBER] DIVIDERS** - a lot of users use emoji dividers, this tells you how many are "supposed" to be used (as in: the format was created with that many)


there's no need to download anything, clicking on the respective files will open a tab where you are able to copy and paste.
these are added to periodically, keep checking for more!
