# sotc.templates
f2u templates for sotc.

- please credit when using, i don't care where the credits are, you're free to move it around.
- keep the credit even if you heavily edit the template.
- you may take inspiration from these templates, i don't mind, but do not pass it off as your own entire idea.
- requests? questions? confused? other fun stuff? contact me @cornflowers. !
- (important notes: i will not make requests to fit your own character, and any requests i take will be posted here to be used by others as well. i probably won't do requests immediately most of the time, i could end up saving them to do at a later date.)


there's no need to download anything, clicking on the respective files will open a tab where you are able to copy and paste.
these are added to periodically, keep checking for more!
